## 📖 Project Overview

**CoreMind** is a full-stack RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application designed to bridge the gap between static documents and interactive AI. Unlike standard chatbots, CoreMind allows users to build a personal knowledge base by uploading PDFs, text files, and **images (via OCR)**.

Built with a focus on **Product Management principles**, the system includes a Feedback Loop (Like/Dislike), an Analytics Dashboard to track KPI (Latency, Token Usage), and a robust Admin Interface.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Core Functionality
* **RAG Pipeline:** Retrieves precise answers from your own documents using **Qdrant** (Vector Search).
* **LLM Powerhouse:** Powered by **Meta Llama 3.3 (70B)** via **Groq LPU** for lightning-fast inference (<1s latency).
* **Computer Vision (OCR):** Extracts text from images and scanned documents using **Tesseract OCR**.
* **Context Awareness:** Remembers chat history and resolves references (e.g., "Where does *he* live?").

### 📊 Admin & Analytics (PM Features)
* **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualizes system performance (Latency trends, Query volume, Model usage).
* **Feedback Loop:** Users can rate responses (👍/👎), creating a dataset for future improvements.
* **Knowledge Management:** UI to view indexed files and delete outdated documents from the vector database.

### 🎭 Adaptive Persona
* **Strict Mode:** Professional and precise for technical queries based on docs.
* **Creative Mode:** Witty and sarcastic (Storyteller persona) for general chit-chat.

## 🏗️ Architecture



The system follows a microservices-like architecture:
1.  **Frontend (Streamlit):** Handles UI, Session State, and Visualization.
2.  **Backend (FastAPI):** Manages API endpoints, File Parsing, and Business Logic.
3.  **Vector Store (Qdrant):** Stores document embeddings for semantic search.
4.  **Inference Engine (Groq):** Generates human-like responses based on retrieved context.
